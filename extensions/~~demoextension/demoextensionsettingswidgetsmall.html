<!--
    This code will be displayed when the user clicks on the extension name in datacenter admin page
it is displayed in a model box (popup) and should be coded accordingly
Important items in this file are:

****** The Invisible section is needed so that the webpage knows what channel to post the data back to

name="" 
    must be added to each form item so that we can extract the data. The name given will be sent with the value
    back to the extension via a socket message when the form is submitted. The format of the return is an array of objects
    [{name,value},{name,value}]
[name]checked
    this will be replaced with checked when we send the modal back ot the server. This allows us to set the defaults in the
    modal ot the current config values. the [name] part must match the value in the name="" tag
[name]text
    Same as above but for text fields

    in this file there are three config variables that match the config in the code
    -channel
    -demoExtensionEnabled
    -demotext1
    These are automatically parsed and set when this code is read before it is sent to be displayed
